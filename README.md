# Pok√©Lex

This React project was created in order to develop a catalogue-like website. It is a Microverse mandatory project in which we need to use our knowledge of React and Redux.
Alongside the options of searching for Pok√©mon, you are able to filter through Generations and read more details about each Pok√©mon.
